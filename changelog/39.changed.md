Make RDS clock optional, move it to the info panel. To enable it, set `Settings->RDS` to `PS+CT`. Also clock is synchronized only once until the receiver or RDS CT is turned on and off (this helps to avoid getting wrong time from incorrectly configured FM stations).  WARNING: this firmware resets the receiver settings!
