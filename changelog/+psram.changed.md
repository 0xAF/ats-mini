Enable PSRAM. WARNING: this hardware feature might not exist on an ESP32-S3 SoC variant intalled in a particular receiver. This might brick the receiver, so make sure it has BOOT & RESET buttons to recover it (see <https://esp32-si4732.github.io/ats-mini/recovery.html#recovery>). To verify whether PSRAM has been enabled after flashing this firmware, visit Menu->Settings->About and scroll to the last page (see MEM PS). Please let us know the results by adding a comment to the following discussion <https://github.com/esp32-si4732/ats-mini/discussions/105>.
If unsure, please avoid installing this version!
