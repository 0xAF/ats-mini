## Recovery

Please ensure the receiver has [BOOT and RESET](hardware.md#boot-and-reset-buttons) buttons on the PCB.

The recovery process is as follows:

1. Power on the receiver
2. Connect it via USB to a computer
3. Press and hold the BOOT button
4. Press the RESET button
5. Release the BOOT button

The receiver will enter into the recovery mode and you can flash the ESP32-S3 controller as usual.
