## BOOT and RESET buttons

Some of the ESP32-SI4732 receivers do not have the BOOT and RESET buttons soldered in. You will need these buttons if you want to recover a receiver that was bricked because of a failed flashing process.

You can use a pair of precision tweezers like this to short the button contacts:

Or solder the missing buttons:
